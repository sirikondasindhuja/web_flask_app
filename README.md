 Implementing a Flask Web Application

Objective: Build a web application using the Flask web framework in Python.
Description:
•	Set up a Flask project structure with routes for handling different URL endpoints.

•	Create HTML templates for rendering dynamic content using Jinja2 templating engine.

•	Implement functionalities such as user registration, login/logout, and profile management.

•	Connect the web application to a backend database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for storing user data

ABSTRACT
In this project, we aim to develop a feature-rich web application using the Flask web framework in Python. Our objective is to create a robust and user-friendly platform with functionalities including user registration, login/logout, and profile management, while seamlessly integrating with a backend database.
We begin by setting up a Flask project structure, defining routes to handle different URL endpoints. Leveraging Flask's modular design, we organize our application logic into view functions, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
Next, we create HTML templates using the Jinja2 templating engine, enabling dynamic content rendering. These templates serve as the visual interface for user interactions, providing a responsive and intuitive user experience.
To implement user management functionalities, we integrate features for user registration, login, and logout. Utilizing Flask's built-in session management and authentication mechanisms, we ensure secure access control and protect sensitive user data.
Furthermore, we establish a connection to a backend database, such as SQLite or PostgreSQL, to store user information and profile data. By leveraging Flask-SQLAlchemy or similar libraries, we facilitate seamless interaction between the web application and the database, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
Throughout the development process, we prioritize scalability, security, and usability, adhering to best practices in web application development. By combining the flexibility of Flask with the power of relational databases, our project showcases a robust and extensible solution for building dynamic web applications.
